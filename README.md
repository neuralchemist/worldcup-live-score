This app is developed using Test Driven Development (TDD). All the test are implmented using React Testing Library and Jest.
Since unit test breaks on refactoring, all the tests in the app are integration test. Focused on tests that will not break on refactoring the code ie. as long as the behavior of the components do not change.

Used SOLID principle to break the features into small reusable components.
Used CSS module for styling.
